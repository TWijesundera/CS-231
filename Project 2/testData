The Moody Blues were formed in May of 1964.  Their members were:
Denny Laine, Clint Warwick, Mike Pinder, Ray Thomas, and Graeme Edge.  During the years 1965 - 1967, they focused primarily on R & B, their  most famous single being "Go Now," which reached number one on the charts in both the U.S. and Great Britain.

In 1966, Denny Laine and Clint Warwick left the group and were
replaced by Justin Hayward and John Lodge.  They abandoned the old
R & B, and in 1967 recorded their most famous album, _Days of Future
Passed_.  This was supposed to be a demo record for Decca to
demonstrate its version of stereo.  The band never actually played
with the orchestra;  they recorded their songs and Peter Knight, the
orchestra leader, composed music to fit around it.  Apparently, Decca
*hated* _DOFP_, but they released it anyway, since they'd already
spent the money.  Good thing for us fans, since it contained _Nights
In White Satin_, which later became their most famous song, as well as
_Tuesday Afternoon_, which became their first big hit from the album.
The album remained on Billboard charts a full two years after its
release.

During the years 1967 - 1972, they recorded seven very successful
albums, all of which went gold.  In 1972, _Days of Future Passed_ was
re-released, and incredibly went gold again, a full five years after
the original release of the album!

However, amidst their skyrocketing popularity, The Moody Blues broke
up in February, 1974.  This popularity had turned out to be the band's
downfall. But individual members continued recording solo albums, many
of which did extremely well on the pop charts.
